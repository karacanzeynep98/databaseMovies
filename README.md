# Intro to Databases Final Project
Movies are an essential component of the intellectual human experience. We escape our daily lives through movies - be it in the theater, with our friends in the cinema rooms in Residential Colleges or in our dorm rooms. Movies unite people - but who unites movies? What sort of platform exists to understand the realm of cinematic productions better?

We started off with this problem. We decided to implement a search interface for movies. We chose the most commonly discussed parameters: title, popularity, vote average, original language and budget. Our search engine allows you to search any movie from the IMDB database based on the aforementioned parameters. 

# How to Run 
In order to run this website, there are a few steps:

1) Clone/download the github repo on your computer.
2) Go to dbUI folder. Run "npm run serve" in terminal.
3) Go to dbServer folder. Run "node dbserver.js"
4) Go to dbData folder. Extract/download csv files. (If you've already downloaded, make sure you change the path to the correct folder)
5) Go to dbSQL folder. There, you will find the SQL commands to run MySQL. We used an IDE called PopSQL to create the tables
and fetch the data from csv tables. There is an example database that we created called "giraffe" and there is a screenshot of 
credentials of giraffe database. You can create your own database, but make sure once you get the data csv tables you change the path to be able to load the tables to the database.
