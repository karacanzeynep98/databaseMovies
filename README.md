# Intro to Databases Final Project
Movies are an essential component of the intellectual human experience. We escape our daily lives through movies - be it in the theater, with our friends in the cinema rooms in Residential Colleges or in our dorm rooms. Movies unite people - but who unites movies? What sort of platform exists to understand the realm of cinematic productions better?

We started off with this problem. We decided to implement a search interface for movies. We chose the most commonly discussed parameters: title, popularity, vote average, original language and budget. Our search engine allows you to search any movie from the IMDB database based on the aforementioned parameters.
